## Godot 3.5.3 Third Person Controller

Faithful recreation of WaffleAWT's [Godot 4.1 Third Person Controller](https://github.com/WaffleAWT/Godot-4.1-Third-Person-Controller) in Godot 3.5.3, plus added Android support with virtual joystick from [MarcoFazioRandom](https://github.com/MarcoFazioRandom/Virtual-Joystick-Godot/tree/v3).

When selecting Prototype node, there's an `Android Mode` toggle on it. Turning it on will change the orientation into portrait and adds virtual joystick, while turning it off will hide said joystick and revert the orientation.

You have exported variables both on the Player and the SpringArmPivot nodes where you can control movement and FOV.

Assets are taken directly from WaffleAWT's repo. Special thanks to him.
